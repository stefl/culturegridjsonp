        Culturegrid JSONP API

      %p
        Let's say you want to consume microformats from an external website using javascript on your own website. Browser security prohibits it.

      %h2
        Send a GET request of this format to this little web service:
      
      %div#get
        %a{:href=>"http://culturegrid.heroku.com/search?q=joy&page=1&per_page=10&callback=abc123"}
          http://culturegrid.heroku.com/search?q=joy&page=1&per_page=10&callback=abc123
      
      %h2
        You will receive something like the following as JSONP:

What is interesting though is that while <strong>6x more developers use microformats</strong>, Google is finding <strong>16x more microformats for rich snippets</strong> than alternatives. </p>\n<p>One could conclude from these two numbers that <strong>developers using microformats are 2-3 times more net productive</strong> in terms of number of pages produced with rich snippets. This net productivity could be because microformats are easier (take less time) to author, and possibly that microformats are easier to get right, and thus have Google recognize them, as compared to alternatives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"make-it-simpler\"><a href=\"#make-it-simpler\" style=\"text-decoration:none;border:0\">Making Micoformats Even Simpler</a></h4>\n<p>Still, we can do even better than that.  And no, I&#8217;m not just talking about going from 94% to 99+%.</p>\n<p>The Google presentation slide noted that the results were out of <q>one million web pages sampled from the Internet</q>.  Out of that, <em>only</em> ~40,000 had microformats.  Given that nearly every web page mentions people, organizations, events, or some other popular microformat, that number should be much higher.</p>\n<p>Thus there is much room for us to improve, and in particular, based on feedback, from Google, Yahoo, from numerous smaller companies and independent web developers, we can and should make microformats <em>even</em> simpler.  Simpler to write, easier to get right, and ideally, even more micro &#8211; less code, less page weight.  Starting with a <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2010-05-02-microformats-2-0\">few ideas brainstormed a couple of months ago</a>, there&#8217;s now a few folks working on a &#8220;microformats 2.0&#8243; to achieve these goals.</p>\n<p>Do you have feedback or ideas about how microformats could be made even simpler and easier <em>for authors</em>?</p>\n<p>Please add your thoughts to the &#8220;<a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/microformats-made-simpler\">microformats-made-simpler</a>&#8221; wiki page.</p>\n<p>Have you implemented hCard profiles on your site?  </p>\n<p>Add your site to the <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-supporting-user-profiles\">hCard supporting user profiles</a> page.</p>\n<p>Thanks to all of the hard work and contributions by everyone in the microformats community for an excellent fifth year of microformats.org.

We knew that it would be only a matter of time for tool support to come along to utilize our recipe data. As Front End Engineers, we have real control over what are pages output, and we have a real opportunity maximize the amount of data that a tool like Google can glean from our markup. It would be a poor practice to not take advantage of microformats when something as powerful as Google recognizes their importance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s further work to do with ironing out the kinks in the hRecipe format, but I think this certainly shows the benefit of being an early adopter and getting these formats out into the wild for real stress-testing.

Over thirty folks went further and donated at the door, but more importantly, everyone contributed their time and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Applying the lessons of prior <a href=\"http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/07/13/what-is-a-devcamp/\">devCamps</a>, the group proposed dozens of ideas and came together around <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-07-25-dev-camp#projects\">7 projects</a>. Many of them ended up sharing their results as open-source on <a href=\"http://github.com/blog/468-microformats-on-github\"> github</a>; others created bespoke sites and yet other conversations impacted projects folks were already working on.</p>\n<p>In an increasingly online world, I think the primary lesson of this devCamp was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau\">Robert Cailliau</a>‘s classic quote, “<a href=\"http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/volume-42-number-3/dr-robert-cailliau-part-one\">there is no such thing as a virtual beer.</a>” It&#8217;s refreshing to see that putting this many bright and opinionated folks in one place, at one time, actually results in concrete progress. I’d like to think at least a little of the credit is due to the minimalist philosophy of the microformats.org movement&#8230; </p>\n<p>Probably the only serious glitch was softwear-related; our initial rush t-shirt order didn’t turn out as we expected, so we’re spending a bit more to order new, higher-quality shirts.

What is interesting though is that while <strong>6x more developers use microformats</strong>, Google is finding <strong>16x more microformats for rich snippets</strong> than alternatives. </p>\n<p>One could conclude from these two numbers that <strong>developers using microformats are 2-3 times more net productive</strong> in terms of number of pages produced with rich snippets. This net productivity could be because microformats are easier (take less time) to author, and possibly that microformats are easier to get right, and thus have Google recognize them, as compared to alternatives.</p>\n<h4 id=\"make-it-simpler\"><a href=\"#make-it-simpler\" style=\"text-decoration:none;border:0\">Making Micoformats Even Simpler</a></h4>\n<p>Still, we can do even better than that.  And no, I&#8217;m not just talking about going from 94% to 99+%.</p>\n<p>The Google presentation slide noted that the results were out of <q>one million web pages sampled from the Internet</q>.  Out of that, <em>only</em> ~40,000 had microformats.  Given that nearly every web page mentions people, organizations, events, or some other popular microformat, that number should be much higher.</p>\n<p>Thus there is much room for us to improve, and in particular, based on feedback, from Google, Yahoo, from numerous smaller companies and independent web developers, we can and should make microformats <em>even</em> simpler.

The information being displayed is formed from extracts of hRecipe marked up data.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/phae_/4560222315/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4031/4560222315_107af02544.jpg\" alt=\"hRecipes in Google results\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mwunsch.tumblr.com/post/556026977/hrecipe-snippets\">Mark Wunsch</a>, a developer for <a href=\"http://www.foodnetwork.com/\">FoodNetwork</a> and <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/prism\">Prism parser</a>, who now finds his microformatted recipes displayed on Google search results pages had this to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When we revisited our recipe pages on FoodNetwork.com a few months ago, it was one of our priorities in Front End Engineering to embed hRecipe. We knew that it would be only a matter of time for tool support to come along to utilize our recipe data. As Front End Engineers, we have real control over what are pages output, and we have a real opportunity maximize the amount of data that a tool like Google can glean from our markup. It would be a poor practice to not take advantage of microformats when something as powerful as Google recognizes their importance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&#8217;s further work to do with ironing out the kinks in the hRecipe format, but I think this certainly shows the benefit of being an early adopter and getting these formats out into the wild for real stress-testing.  Congratulations to <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe#Contributors\">all those involved</a>!</p>\n<p>With Google now officially supporting these two formats, plus <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146646\">people</a> and <a href=\"http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=146645\">reviews</a>, we eagerly anticipate their further adoption of additional microformats into Rich Snippets.</p>","tags":["google","hcalendar","hrecipe","rich snippets"],"domain":"microformats.org","bookmark":"http://microformats.org/2010/04/28/google-adds-support-for-hcalendar-and-hrecipe-rich-snippets","updated":" \r\n                            April 28th, 2010","entry_title":"Google adds support for hCalendar and hRecipe Rich Snippets"}},{"HEntry":{"author":{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://tantek.com/","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Tantek"}},"entry_content":"<p>It&#8217;s been a while since we&#8217;ve posted a &#8220;This Week in Microformats&#8221;, and September was a particularly active month for microformats:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#y2009-09-imps\">new hResume and hCard implementations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#y2009-09-nice-hcards\">beautiful hCards, MySpace hCards</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#y2009-09-tuts-devs\">new tutorials and developments</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"y2009-09-imps\">new hResume and hCard implementations</h4>\n<p><span class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://madgex.com/\" class=\"fn org url\">Madgex</a></span>&#8217;s brand new <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume\" rel=\"tag\">hResume</a> importer powers the <span class=\"vcard\"><span class=\"fn org\">Guardian UK</span></span>&#8217;s recently launched <a href=\"http://jobs.guardian.co.uk/profile/\">Guardian Jobs CV Match</a> service.

Three in particular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://timvandamme.com/\" class=\"fn n url\"><span class=\"given-name\">Tim</span> <span class=\"family-name\">Van Damme</span></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/microformats/3988698726/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2441/3988698726_675c0af031_m.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of Tim Van Damme's hCard\" style=\"display:block\" /></a></li>\n<li class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://rogieking.com/#contact\" class=\"fn url\">Rogie King</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/microformats/3987943075/\"><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3504/3987943075_8c857ea23e_m.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of Rogie King's hCard\" style=\"display:block\" /></a></li>\n<li class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://www.jaredhanson.net/\" class=\"url fn\">Jared Hanson</a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/microformats/3988698866\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/3988698866_b2b51abf19_m.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of Jared Hanson's hCard\" style=\"display:block\" /></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All three make good use of CSS for styling and layout, and Javascript for dynamic effects. The last of the 3, Jared&#8217;s, is more simply styled than the other two, however if you look closely, his list of instant message network addresses also display his live availability on each, a really nice touch.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/microformats/3987943171\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2473/3987943171_5e2383a1d4_m.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot of Jared Hanson's instant message addresses annotated visually with his presence on each\" style=\"display:block;margin:auto\" /></a></p>\n<p>Got a beautiful hCard you want noticed? Add it to the <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples-in-wild\">hCard examples in the wild</a> wiki page.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to highlight individual hCards like the above, as continued proof that people <em>do</em> write web pages, HTML, markup in general, <em>by hand</em>.  Even when such pages are generated from a database used fill out an HTML template, a person still writes the template <em>by hand</em>. And it&#8217;s important to highlight those that update templates as well to support microformats.</p>\n<p>The list of <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-supporting-user-profiles\">social network sites with hCard profiles</a> continues to grow, this time with a big addition: <span class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://myspace.com\" class=\"fn org url\">MySpace</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As of about a month ago, all new MySpace profiles, and all current users who upgrade their profile to version 2.0, automatically get hCard support, as <a href=\"http://developer.myspace.com/Community/forums/p/9026/43520.aspx\">confirmed by MySpace&#8217;s platform developers</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"y2009-09-tuts-devs\">new tutorials and developments</h4>\n<p>Behind all these new microformats implementations and sites is a vibrant and active community, not just here on microformats.org, but across the web as a whole, and across web development communities as well.</p>\n<p>The standards-championing <a href=\"http://dev.opera.com/\">Dev Opera</a> community recently published a wonderful article on <cite><a href=\"http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/styling-and-extracting-hcalendar/\">Styling and extracting hCalendar</a></cite> by <span class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/teleject\" class=\"fn url\">Christopher Schmitt</a></span>, and updated it with use of the <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/value-class-pattern\" rel=\"tag\">value class pattern</a> for better accessibility.</p>\n<p>Safari Books Online and New Riders have made published a video,  <cite><a href=\"http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9780321668646\">Designing with Microformats for a Beautiful Web</a></cite>, by well known web designer <span class=\"vcard\"><a href=\"http://twitter.com/Malarkey\" class=\"fn url\">Andy Clarke</a></span>.</p>\n<p>And finally, last but not least, this past month saw the resolution of all outstanding issues on both hCard and <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar\" rel=\"tag\">hCalendar</a>, paving the way for updates to the specs, FAQs, and 1.0.1 drafts, incorporating important errata, updates, and brainstormed improvements.</p>\n<p>The microformats community was quite busy this summer, and September brought a lot of forward progress.  October is shaping up to be even more impressive.</p>\n<p>For more microformats updates as they happen, be sure to subscribe to the <a href=\"http://microformats.org/discuss\">microformats discuss</a> mailing list and the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/microformats\">@microformats</a> Twitter.</p>","tags":["hResume","parsers page","value class pattern","hCalendar"],"domain":"microformats.org","bookmark":"http://microformats.org/2009/10/06/recently-2009-09","updated":" \r\n                            October 6th, 2009","entry_title":"Recently in microformats: 2009-09"}},{"HEntry":{"author":{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3b145bb8fcaeea70ef07445b5836181?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Rohit"}},"entry_content":"<p>One month later, I wanted to share some observations about <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-07-25-dev-camp\">microformatsDevCamp</a> and my thoughts about why it was so successful.</p>\n<p><span style=\"float:right;margin-left:1em; margin-bottom:.5em;\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/kurafire/3756770573/\"><img src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2665/3756770573_e2d1fee886_m.jpg\" alt=\"microformatsDevCamp Group, Day 1\" /></a></span></p>\n<p>Clearly, it all begins and ends with the people who participate: we were thrilled to have several dozen developers and designers drop in over two days. Over thirty folks went further and donated at the door, but more importantly, everyone contributed their time and enthusiasm.</p>\n<p>Applying the lessons of prior <a href=\"http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2007/07/13/what-is-a-devcamp/\">devCamps</a>, the group proposed dozens of ideas and came together around <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-07-25-dev-camp#projects\">7 projects</a>. Many of them ended up sharing their results as open-source on <a href=\"http://github.com/blog/468-microformats-on-github\"> github</a>; others created bespoke sites and yet other conversations impacted projects folks were already working on.</p>\n<p>In an increasingly online world, I think the primary lesson of this devCamp was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau\">Robert Cailliau</a>‘s classic quote, “<a href=\"http://www.siggraph.org/publications/newsletter/volume-42-number-3/dr-robert-cailliau-part-one\">there is no such thing as a virtual beer.</a>” It&#8217;s refreshing to see that putting this many bright and opinionated folks in one place, at one time, actually results in concrete progress. I’d like to think at least a little of the credit is due to the minimalist philosophy of the microformats.org movement&#8230; </p>\n<p>Probably the only serious glitch was softwear-related; our initial rush t-shirt order didn’t turn out as we expected, so we’re spending a bit more to order new, higher-quality shirts. In the interests of transparency, we will be posting the full, final details online once those are printed and mailed out.</p>\n<p>Of course, an event of this magnitude requires more than just a volunteer labor of love: it takes real resources too.

We’re expecting 30-50 developers to join in, so even as little as $250 can have a real impact towards creating new tools, new applications, and new user interfaces for microformats!</p>\n<p>And, of course, <strong>sign-up</strong> to participate by adding your name and interests to the  <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2009-07-25-dev-camp#attendees\">microformatsDevCamp wiki page</a>!</p>","domain":"microformats.org","bookmark":"http://microformats.org/2009/07/20/microformatsdevcamp-this-weekend","updated":" \r\n                            July 20th, 2009","entry_title":"microformatsDevCamp this weekend!"}},"microformats.org at 5: Two Billion Pages With hCards, 94% of Rich Snippets","\r\n                             \r\n                            July 8th, 2010                        ","Google adds support for hCalendar and hRecipe Rich Snippets","\r\n                             \r\n                            April 28th, 2010                        ","Recently in microformats: 2009-09","\r\n                             \r\n                            October 6th, 2009                        ","Developers’ Notes: microformatsDevCamp","\r\n                             \r\n                            August 24th, 2009                        ","microformatsDevCamp this weekend!","\r\n                             \r\n                            July 20th, 2009                        ",{"HCard":{"org":"37 Signals","fn":"Jason Zimdars"}},{"HCard":{"fn":"Jeremy Keith"}},{"HCard":{"org":"37 Signals","fn":"37 Signals"}},{"HCard":{"org":"Telnic","fn":"Telnic"}},{"HCard":{"org":"Automattic","fn":"Automattic"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://gravatar.com/beau","fn":"Beau Lebens"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://brightkite.com","org":"BrightKite","fn":"BrightKite"}},{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://tantek.com/","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Tantek"}},{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5efecf1ab796b265639688a5825dc449?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://fberriman.com","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Frances"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://madgex.com/","org":"Madgex","fn":"Madgex"}},{"HCard":{"org":"Guardian UK","fn":"Guardian UK"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://microformats.org/wiki/User:TomMorris","fn":"Tom Morris"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://twitter.com/surial","fn":"Reinier Zwitserloot"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://timvandamme.com/","n":"#<OpenStruct family_name=\"Van Damme\", given_name=\"Tim\">","fn":"Tim Van Damme"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://rogieking.com/#contact","fn":"Rogie King"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://www.jaredhanson.net/","fn":"Jared Hanson"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://myspace.com","org":"MySpace","fn":"MySpace"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://twitter.com/teleject","fn":"Christopher Schmitt"}},{"HCard":{"url":"http://twitter.com/Malarkey","fn":"Andy Clarke"}},{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02cd45622e90350cc061aaaa02229195?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://tantek.com/","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Tantek"}},{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3b145bb8fcaeea70ef07445b5836181?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Rohit"}},{"HCard":{"photo":"http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3b145bb8fcaeea70ef07445b5836181?s=16&d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D16&r=PG","url":"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rohit","fn":"\t\t\t\t\t        Rohit"}},"google","hcalendar","hrecipe","rich snippets","hResume","parsers page","value class pattern","hCalendar"])
